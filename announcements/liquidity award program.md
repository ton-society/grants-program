# **Liquidity Award Program**

## What is it?

- $14M TON liquidity award program for teams deploying on TON and bringing users to increase the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem (e.g., bridge, DEX, etc.)
- **6-month cliff and 12-month vesting**
- Rewards will be unlocked on a first-come, first-served basis ranging from $150,000 TON to $3,500,000 TON (paid out in TON). Each project is eligible, but same teams creating both a bridge and a DEX (from which the liquidity is derived from the bridge) may not apply for both projects.
- Rewards are cumulative (meaning, team achieving the highest tier is eligible for $3.5M TON, not $14M TON) 

## Award Tiers (Cumulative)

|        | TVL ($)       | Toncoin (TON) |

|        | $ 27,500,000  | $550,000      |
|        | $ 38,750,000  | $750,000      |
|        | $ 50,000,000  | $950,000      |
| Tier 2 | $ 70,000,000  | $1,250,000    |
|        | $ 90,000,000  | $1,600,000    |

## Additional Guidelines (Examples Only)

Additional guidelines are set in place to prevent cheating. Here are some examples that will be considered:

- Active users (MAU example below)
  - Tier 1: 5,000 - 20,000
  - Tier 2: 50,000 - 100,000
  - Tier 3: 120,000+
- Liquidity of the locked values (i.e., reputability of the projects behind the Jettons added to the pool)
- Website traffic
- Number of wallets
- Number of unique participants

## Terms

- 1-year window with fixed TON price ($1.00)
- Post 1-year window vesting will be at the trailing 1-month average TON spot price
- 6-month cliff and 12-month vesting (see example below)
- Awards vested monthly starting from the half-year mark (e.g. T+6 (months)) based on time-weighted average TVL (rolling 6-months lookback)
- During the vesting period, TVL must stay above the lowest level (i.e., $5M) - otherwise, vesting is paused
- Award vested will be calculated based on the time-weighted average of 75% of the highest tier achieved (see example below)
- Teams must provide information about the protocol via GitHub pull request and public TVL reporting

Example: 
- Let's assume Liquidity Award Program official start date is Jan 1 Year 1 (1/1 Y1). 
- On March 1 (3/1), 2 months after the start date, Team A decides to apply for the program for their bridge after having achieved ~$50M in TVL. Team A's approved start date is as of 3/1. 
- On June 1 (6/1), Team A's bridge hits peak TVL of $110M. 
- On September 1 (9/1), 6-months after Team A's approved start date, the TVL has fallen back down to $70M. For the 6-months cliff vesting, the 50% of the award will be paid for the tier in which 50% of the highest tier achieved was maintained as time-weighted average during the 6-months period. For example, based on the up-and-down of TVL throughout the 6-months, the weighted-average TVL achieved was $80M. Even though Team A's bridge at its height achieved $110M TVL, as the average is $80M, which is lower than $82.5M needed for the highest tier to unlock ($110M x 0.75), it is not eligible for the $110M TVL award tier. The next highest tier is $90M, which requires $67.5M time-weighted average. As the average was $80M, and thus higher than the $67.5M, Team A will receive $800K in TON ($1.6M x 6/12). 
- For the reamining 6 months, same logic will apply but with a 1-month look-back and ~8.3% (1/12) of the highest tier. Starting Jan 1 Year 2 (1/1 Y2), 10 months after Team A's start date, the TON amount to be awarded will be based on the 1-month average price of TON. For example, from 1/1 Y2 to 2/1 Y2, average TON price was $4 and Team A bridge's average TVL was $75M. This results in another month of $90M tier unlock, but at $4 per TON (since the 1-year window fixed price of $1 has passed), bringing the total TON payout to 33,333 ($1.6M / 12 / $4).    

## Conditions

- Initial approval by TON Society and pre-determined start date (T+0) & lookback date (T+6) required
- Sum of funds deposited in the contract must be liquid tokens 
- Definition of liquid tokens for TVL calculation is up to the discretion of TON Society (e.g., major stablecoins, wrapped BTC, TON, etc.)

## Awards Usage

While we do not place restrictions on the awards usage (whether the team reinvests back into the protocol or funds another project), any report that the award is misused in a way that is negative to the ecosystem will be subject to review and result in possible termination of rewards.

*T&C subject to change at the discretion of TON Society, based on community feedback.* *Guidelines will factor in as needed (e.g., heavy concentration of LTV in small number of MAU will be subject to further inquiries).*
